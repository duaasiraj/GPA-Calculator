# GPA-Calculator
As a student at FAST GPA calculation after each test became a hassle so I decided to make a GPA calculator in python to keep track of my own academic performance. Feel free to download the executable file and run it in terminal to use it :)
GPA system followed for BS in FAST-NUCES:
- A = 86% (4.00)
- A- = 82% (3.67)
- B+ = 78% (3.33)
- B = 74% (3.00)
- B- = 70% (2.67)
- C+ = 66% (2.33)
- C = 62% (2.00)
- C- = 58% (1.67)
- D+ = 54% (1.33)
- D = 50% (1.00)
- F=<50% (0.00)
